Author: Dawid Wisniewski


Project description and data source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction



Next TODO:
* select breads from similar breeds and decide what to do with it
* decide how to analyze colors
* merge picture data with extended dataset
* consider adding labels in the main dataset
*
* start looking at data
- look for nans and decide what to do
- charts
- dependencies vs Adoption time

Potential TODO when project is done
- pull raw picture data?
- use metadata from additional pictures? [rather not]
