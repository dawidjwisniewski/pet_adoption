Sages Kodolamacz final project - Pet Adoption Projection

Author: Dawid Wisniewski

Goal of the project: The goal of the project is to predict the speed at which a pet is adopted, based on the petâ€™s listing on PetFinder site. Our additional yet important objective is to identify the best practices that positively impact the adoption speed so that the future pet profiles are created to speed up the adoption speed

Data: The data included text, tabular, and image data. See below for details.
